#Tokenized Realty Contract
This repository contains smart contracts for the Tokenized Realty Contract, a decentralized application (DApp) that handles property tokenization, liquidity management, financial metrics, fee calculations, emergency handling, and more.

###Project Structure
##Key Files & Contracts
1. amm.clar
The AMM (Automated Market Maker) contract handles the logic for decentralized asset exchange, particularly related to property tokenization. It includes functionality to perform property token swaps and manage liquidity pools. The contract ensures efficient pricing of assets by using automated formulas.

##Key Features:

Swapping of tokenized properties.
Dynamic pricing for property tokens based on market conditions.
Liquidity pool management for property tokens.

2. liquidity-pool.clar
The Liquidity Pool contract manages the funds available for property token trades and liquidity provision. It ensures that there is enough liquidity for users to swap tokens without significantly affecting market prices.

##Key Features:

Manages liquidity pool balances.
Tracks token reserves.
Supports addition and removal of liquidity.

3. dao.clar
The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) contract governs the decentralized voting and decision-making processes for the Tokenized Realty platform. It allows property owners and other stakeholders to vote on key governance issues.

##Key Features:

Voting on proposals for property management.
Decentralized governance for decision-making.
Allows for community-driven changes to the system.

4. fee-manager.clar
The Fee Manager contract calculates and manages transaction fees within the platform. It supports variable fees for different operations such as token swaps, property transfers, and other financial activities within the Tokenized Realty system.

##Key Features:

Calculation of transaction fees.
Supports dynamic fee structure based on transaction type.
Implements fee distribution logic for reward pools or governance.


5. emergency-brake.clar
The Emergency Brake contract serves as a critical emergency stop mechanism within the platform. It can pause or stop all activities on the system in case of security breaches, contract vulnerabilities, or other unforeseen issues. It is used to mitigate risk and prevent the loss of assets.

##Key Features:

Pause or stop specific contracts or functions in the event of an emergency.
Enable/disable key system functionalities as needed.
Emergency recovery features to ensure platform integrity.


6. metrics.clar
The Metrics contract is used to monitor and report the performance of the properties tokenized within the system. It includes financial, risk, and operational metrics for each property, allowing stakeholders to track the performance of their assets over time.

##Key Features:

Financial metrics (e.g., ROI, yield).
Risk metrics (e.g., volatility, liquidity score).
Operational metrics (e.g., maintenance costs, tenant satisfaction).
Tracks performance of tokenized properties.
7. events.clar
The Events contract logs important actions or changes within the platform. It captures key events like system initialization, property transfers, and error occurrences. This helps in debugging, tracking system activities, and reporting events.

##Key Features:

Event logging for contract calls.
Logs critical activities and their associated details.
Logs errors and system failures for audit purposes.


8. emergency-tests.clar
The Emergency Tests contract contains the test suite for the Emergency Brake system. It verifies that the emergency brake mechanism works as intended by simulating various emergency scenarios and confirming that the system halts or behaves correctly in those cases.

##Key Features:

Tests for triggering and disabling the emergency brake.
Verifies the integrity of the emergency stop functionality.


9. security-tests.clar
The Security Tests contract contains a collection of security-related tests for the platform. It ensures that there are no vulnerabilities in critical operations, including asset transfers, fee management, and emergency stopping mechanisms.

##Key Features:

Security tests for contract integrity.
Verification of risk mitigation strategies.

##Utility Files
1. iEventLogger.clar
The Event Logger interface defines the structure for logging events across the platform. It is used by other contracts (e.g., metrics.clar, dao.clar) to log activities, errors, and other events.

##Key Features:

Defines the event logging structure.
Provides a reusable logging interface for other contracts.

2. iErrorConstants.clar
The Error Constants contract defines a set of error constants that are used across the platform for standardized error handling. These constants are used for consistency and to provide meaningful error messages.

##Key Features:

Centralized error constants for easy maintenance.
Used by other contracts to define and handle errors.
Key Features of the Platform
Property Tokenization: The core functionality of the platform is the ability to tokenize real estate assets and make them tradable on a decentralized exchange.
Decentralized Governance: Decisions about the platform’s operations are made via a DAO, ensuring that token holders have control over the platform’s future.
Liquidity Pools: Users can provide liquidity for property tokens, allowing for easy trading without significant price impact.
Risk and Performance Metrics: The platform provides detailed metrics about the properties being tokenized, including financial, operational, and risk metrics.
Emergency Brake: In case of an emergency or attack, the platform can be paused or halted to prevent further damage.
Fee Management: The platform uses a fee management system to calculate and distribute fees for different operations on the platform.

###Getting Started
#Prerequisites
Install Clarinet for testing and running the contracts.
Install dependencies using npm install if necessary for tests.
Familiarize yourself with Clarity, the language used for writing the smart contracts.

##Running Tests
Run Emergency Brake Tests:

clarinet test
Run General Security and Functionality Tests: Use npm or vitest to run tests that are written for different parts of the system.
